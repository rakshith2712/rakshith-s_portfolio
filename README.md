# [ Project 1: 911 Call Analysis Model ](https://rakshith2712.github.io/rakshith-s_portfolio/911_call_analysis_model)
This is a my first project while learning data analysis during my Bachelor's Degree

* Data was downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert)
* **Data Import & Exploration:** Learned to load large real-world datasets using Pandas, inspect data structure with .info() and .head(), and explore high-frequency categories using .value_counts().
* **Feature Engineering:** Created new columns such as Reason, Hour, Month, Day of Week, and Date by parsing and transforming datetime fields with pd.to_datetime() and .apply() functions.
* **Data Visualization Skills:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps, including countplot, lmplot, and clustermap to identify patterns and trends in emergency calls.
* **Categorical Mapping:** Applied mapping dictionaries to make categorical data (e.g., day numbers → day names) more readable for analysis.
* **Trend & Pattern Analysis:** Analyzed call distribution by Reason (Traffic, EMS, Fire), observed seasonal and daily patterns, and identified peak hours and days for each emergency type.
* **Correlation Insights:** Used heatmaps and clustermaps to visualize correlations between time-based variables (Day of Week × Hour, Day of Week × Month) for deeper temporal pattern recognition.
* **Practical Data Analysis Workflow:** Followed an end-to-end process — from loading raw data to preprocessing, feature creation, and building visual insights — replicating a typical real-world data analytics pipeline.
